# Google Search Clone

This project is a **simple front-end clone** of Googleâ€™s search pages, built for the **CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** course (Harvard).

The goal was to practice **HTML and CSS** by recreating the layout and style of:
- **Google Search** (`index.html`)  
- **Google Images** (`images.html`)  
- **Google Advanced Search** (`advanced.html`)  

All search results are fetched directly from **google.com**, so this is only a **UI clone for learning purposes**.
